My Frontend Journey with BridgeLabz
This repository documents my day-by-day progress as I learn and build frontend projects with BridgeLabz. Each day focuses on a new concept or a hands-on assignment.

🗓️ Day 1: Simple Timetable with HTML & CSS

On the first day, the goal was to create a clear and easy-to-read class timetable. This was accomplished using semantic HTML to structure the table and CSS to style it for better readability and organization. The focus was on creating a clean grid layout that clearly presents the weekly schedule.
