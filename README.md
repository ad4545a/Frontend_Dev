Advanced Selectors: Explored combinators and pseudo-classes to style elements more precisely.

Box Model Practice: Refined skills with height, width, padding, and borders.

🧪 Task for the Day:

Build a calculator UI layout using CSS Grid.

Applied gradients and box shadows to enhance the visual design of the buttons and body.

🧭 What’s Next:

Focusing on making designs adaptable with Responsive Design, CSS Media Queries, and adding motion with transitions.

📅 Day 5: CSS Interactivity & Animations

🧩 What I Learned:

Interactive Styling: Used pseudo-classes like :hover, :focus, and :active to create dynamic styles.

CSS Animations: Learned the difference between transition (for simple state changes) and animation (for complex sequences).

Create a simple diagonal animation.
